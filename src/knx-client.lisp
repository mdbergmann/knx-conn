  "Allows the following messages:

- `(:send . <request>)` to send an knx request to the gateway.
- `(:receive . nil)` to start receive knx requests/responses from the gateway. The receival itself is done in a separate task (sento.tasks API). The received of the receival is forwarded to:
- `(:received . <result>)` looks at what is the type of the received.
For `knx-tunnelling-request`s the registered listener functions will be called. All else will be enqueued in the `*awaited-things*` list, for `:wait-on-resp` to check.
- `(:wait-on-resp . (<resp-type> <start-time> <wait-time>))` to wait (by retrying and checking on the enqueued messages, the actor is not blocked) for a response of type `<resp-type>` until the time `<start-time> + <wait-time> (defaults to *resp-wait-timeout-secs*, can be dynamically overridden by `let')` has elapsed. If the time has elapsed, a condition of type `knx-receive-error` will be signalled. If a response of the correct type is received, the response will be replied to the sender of the request.
The awaiting of responses works on the communication layer of knx-ip, i.e. search request response, description response/request, connection state request/response, (dis)connect request/response, plus tunnelling request/ack (because those are also quite high-level and can be distinguished on a message type).
Waiting on responses for specific tunnelling requests on an L_Data level must be done via tunnelling listeners.
- `(:heartbeat . nil)` to send a connection-state request to the KNXnet/IP gateway.
- `(:add-tunnel-req-listener . <listener-fun>)` to add a listener function for tunnelling requests.
- `(:rem-tunnel-req-listener . <listener-fun>)` to remove a listener function for tunnelling requests.
- `(:clr-tunnel-req-listeners . nil)` to clear all listener functions for tunnelling requests."
